# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will showcase my personal project, which reflect my skills and interest in data analysis and programming. This repository will be continuously updated as I develop new projects.

## Current Projects
### 1. Video Game Sales Data Analysis
This project focuses on analysing video game sales globally using R.
The project includes:
- **Data visualization**: Creating insightful plots and graphs to showcase sales trends.
- **Linear regression**: Analyzing relationships between variables
- **Random forest**: Evaluating the significance of different variables.
  
You can access this project in both PDF and RMarkdown formats under the "Game_sales_data_analysis" folder.

### 2. Spam Filter using Naive Bayes Algorithm

This project involves building an SMS spam filter using the Naive Bayes Algorithm.
This project includes:
- **Text classification**: Training a model to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.
- **Bayesian probability**: Calculating the likelihood of a message being spam based on word frequencies.

You can access this project in both PDF and RMarkdown formats under the "spam_filter" folder.


## Planned Projects

- **Predicting condominium Sales Prices using R**
- **Fraud Detection using Python and SQL**
- **Customer retention on a food delivery app**

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to sharing more work soon!
