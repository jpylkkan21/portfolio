# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will showcase my personal project, which reflect my skills and interest in data analysis and programming. This repository will be continuously updated as I develop new projects.

## Current Projects
### 1. Video Game Sales Data Analysis
The first project focuses on analysing video game sales globally using R.
The project includes:
- **Data visualization**: Creating insightful plots and graphs to showcase sales trends.
- **Linear regression**: Analyzing relationships between variables
- **Random forest**: Evaluating the significance of different variables.
You can access this project in both PDF and RMarkdown formats under the "Game_sales_data_analysis" folder.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to sharing more work soon"
